# Case: Product Feeder System

Cimri, Google or Facebook wants products data from e-commerce systems for advertising or listing on their systems. E-commerce systems provide a file or feed through an API with all product data for each system in formats supported by the platforms (JSON, XML etc.).

We expect you to implement a feeder system in PHP. The system should be set up to create files in the formats requested by the platforms. Following should be considered;

- Framework or library should not be used.

- Coding style and code optimization are important.

- It should be extendible so we can add new platform to the system easily. Consider supporting 500 different platforms easily on your architecture.

- Example platforms are given above. Platform count, the format supported by the platform does not matter. However, since we want to see how the system is designed by you, we expect output in at least 2 different formats (JSON, XML).

Sample products are in the products.json file in attachment.

 - run "composer install" on terminal.
